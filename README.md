$\Psi$ model is a non-general relativity full waveform for general parametrization of axisymmetric black holes. The model comprises two main components: an inspiral part obtained by using a phenomenological method in the frequency domain and a ringdown part derived from quasinormal modes associated with photon motion. The detailed information can be found in https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.083032

### Inspiral part

$\phi_{\mathrm{Ins}}=  \phi_{\mathrm{TF} 2}(M f ; \Xi)  +\frac{1}{\eta}\left(\sigma_{0}+\sigma_{1} f+\frac{3}{4} \sigma_{2} f^{4 / 3}+\frac{3}{5} \sigma_{3} f^{5 / 3}+\frac{1}{2} \sigma_{4} f^{2}\right)+\phi_{\mathrm{KRZ}}$


where $\eta=m_1 m_2/M^2$, $M = m_1+m_2$, the $\phi_{\mathrm{TF} 2}$ is the full TaylorF2 phase:

$\phi_{\mathrm{TF} 2}=  2 \pi f t_{c}-\varphi_{c}-\pi / 4  +\frac{3}{128 \eta}(\pi f M)^{-5 / 3} \sum_{i=0}^{7} \varphi_{i}(\Xi)(\pi f M)^{i / 3}$

The constants $\sigma_{i}$ (where $i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$) represent the correlation between the mass and spin of the system. Meanwhile, the phase deformation arising from the general parameterized black hole is denoted by $\phi_{\mathrm{KRZ}}$. Varying the values of $\delta_1$, $\delta_2$, $\delta_4$, and $\delta_6$ will result in different phases. $\varphi_{i}(\Xi)$ are the PN expansion coefficients that are related to the intrinsic binary parameters. 



### Intermediate part

The intermediate stage is after the inspiral stage, and its phase is given by

$\phi_{\mathrm{Int}}=\frac{1}{\eta}\left(\beta_0+\beta_1 f+\beta_2 \log (f)-\frac{\beta_3}{3} f^{-3}\right)$

$\beta_{i}(i=0, 1, 2, 3)$ is the constants related to the mass and spin of the system.



### Ringdown part
The real part of QNMs, $\omega_R$, can be decomposed into two directional components, namely, $\theta$ and $\phi$:

$\omega_R=L\Omega_{\theta}(m/L)+m\Omega_{\mathrm{prec}}(m/L)$
where $\Omega_{\theta}$ indicates the frequency of polar motion, which is the rate at which the photon oscillates above and below the equatorial plane. The oscillation period can be calculated using the formula, $T_{\theta}=2\pi/\Omega_{\theta}$.

In addition to polar motion, the particle also undergoes a periodic motion in the azimuthal ($\phi$) direction with respect to the oscillation period, $T_{\theta}$, and the magnitude, $\Delta \phi$. The deviation between $\Delta \phi$ and $\pm 2\pi$ is commonly known as the "precession angle":


$\Delta \phi_{\mathrm{prec} }=\Delta \phi +4\pi\quad(\mathrm{corotating \; orbit} )$ or $\Delta \phi_{\mathrm{prec} }=\Delta \phi -4\pi\quad(\mathrm{couterrotating \; orbit})$


$\Omega_{\mathrm{prec}}=\Delta\phi_{\mathrm{prec} }/T_{\theta}$

$L=l+1/2$.

The values of $l$ and $m$ could be determined through the conditions: 
$V^{r}\left(r, \omega_{R}\right)=\left.\frac{\partial V^{r}}{\partial r}\right|_{\left(r, \omega_{R}\right)}=0$, 
and $V^r$ is the potential in the radial Teukolsky equation. The imaginary component of QNMs, $\omega_I$, is directly linked to the Lyapunov exponents, which determine the rate at which a circular null geodesic expands its cross-sectional area under infinitesimal radial perturbations.
