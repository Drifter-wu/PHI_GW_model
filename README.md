$\Psi$ model is a non-general relativity full waveform for general parametrization of axisymmetric black holes. The model comprises two main components: an inspiral part obtained by using a phenomenological method in the frequency domain and a ringdown part derived from quasinormal modes associated with photon motion. The detailed information can be found in https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.083032

### Inspiral part


$\phi_{\mathrm{Ins}}=  \phi_{\mathrm{TF} 2}(M f ; \Xi)  +\frac{1}{\eta}\left(\sigma_{0}+\sigma_{1} f+\frac{3}{4} \sigma_{2} f^{4 / 3}+\frac{3}{5} \sigma_{3} f^{5 / 3}+\frac{1}{2} \sigma_{4} f^{2}\right)+\phi_{\mathrm{KRZ}}$


where $\eta=m_1 m_2/M^2$, $M = m_1+m_2$, the $\phi_{\mathrm{TF} 2}$ is the full TaylorF2 phase:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\phi_{\mathrm{TF} 2}= & 2 \pi f t_{c}-\varphi_{c}-\pi / 4 \\
& +\frac{3}{128 \eta}(\pi f M)^{-5 / 3} \sum_{i=0}^{7} \varphi_{i}(\Xi)(\pi f M)^{i / 3}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The constants $\sigma_{i}$ (where $i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$) represent the correlation between the mass and spin of the system. Meanwhile, the phase deformation arising from the general parameterized black hole is denoted by $\phi_{\mathrm{KRZ}}$. Varying the values of $\delta_1$, $\delta_2$, $\delta_4$, and $\delta_6$ will result in different phases. $\varphi_{i}(\Xi)$ are the PN expansion coefficients that are related to the intrinsic binary parameters.
